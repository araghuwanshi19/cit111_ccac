#Project Description

The project functions as a molarity calculator as it computes the molarity of a solution based on the user's input. 

The input that the calculator requires to undergo the computation:
- the Chemical formula of the compound(solute)
- the mass of the solvent (in grams)
- the volume (in litres) of water that the solute is being disolved in.

A key thing to note about this project is that it involves the use of elements in JAVA that are yet to be learned in the level 1 class.These include the use of Hashmaps and Regular Expressions/regex.

###Limitations in the code:
* The code is yet to be tested by users and it is likely for bugs to detected in the code.
* The calculator requires for specific values and does not provide the with othwer ways that molarity of a solution can be found.
* The calculator is only capable of computing the molarity of solutions with water as its solvent. 

These limitations can inturn pose to be key areas for expansion.


##Update: the code does not work
